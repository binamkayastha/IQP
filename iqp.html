                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.maineyankee.com/public/pdfs/epri/my%20epri%20report-2005.pdf">If a company is considering a CAP or its equivalent, it must understand and accept the level of effort needed to keep it going. When the Maine Yankee CAP was started, the "care and feeding of CAP" was essentially a full time position for one person. A substantial effort was made in the first two years in order to build the trust and credibility needed for success. In addition to the staff support, Maine Yankee budgeted for the travel and education opportunities provided to the CAP members as well as the dinners provided prior to each CAP meeting. Nominally, this was approximately $20,000 per year, but was viewed by Maine Yankee as providing real value for the funds and effort expended. MY 8</a><br>
                The panel was considered effective by former CAP Chair Marge Kilkelly and long time CAP staff person Eric Howes both of whom we interviewed.. The pair said that one of the hallmarks of the panel's success was the fact that it is still functioning today, 20 years after closure. Eric Howes Interview<br>
